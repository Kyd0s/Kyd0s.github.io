I’m a Technical Specialist working full-time in a large virtualized environment. Think incident response, change management, and keeping chaos at bay across hundreds of systems.
My love for IT started way before the job titles, since very young in fact.
I was tearing apart old PCs, overclocking CPUs just to see what would break, fixing busted hardware, and building rigs from scrap parts. That hands-on obsession hasn’t stopped.
These days, outside of the 9-5, I’m deep in ethical hacking by night. You’ll find me grinding on ```Hack The Box```, ```TryHackMe```, and any box that throws a challenge my way. Always learning, always leveling up.

I hold a few certs:

```AZ-900 – Azure Fundamentals```

```AZ-104 – Azure Administrator Associate```

```PJPT – Practical Junior Penetration Tester (TCM Security)```

This blog is my little corner of the internet.
A place to share walkthroughs, pentesting reports from CTFs, and document my journey through the rabbit holes.
Expect content from retired machines (no spoilers for active ones), CTF notes, maybe some tooling experiments, and the occasional rant.
Just trying to give back, share what I learn, and maybe help someone else get started on their own hacking path.

Hope you enjoy the content.
